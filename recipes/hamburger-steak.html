        Ingredients
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking sherry</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Steps
      </h2>

      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, 
          egg, bread crumbs, pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic 
          powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Form into 8 balls, 
          and flatten into patties.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
          Fry the patties and onion in the oil until patties 
          are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove 
          the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in 
          the skillet. Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits 
          of beef off of the bottom as you stir. Gradually mix 
          in the beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned 
          salt. Simmer and stir over medium-low heat for about 
          5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, 
          return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for 
          another 15 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
